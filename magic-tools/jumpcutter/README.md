Video Processing Server using FastAPI
The provided Python scripts, main.py and jump_cutter.py, jointly create a video processing server using FastAPI.

Overview
main.py: This script sets up a FastAPI server and exposes two endpoints for video processing:

POST /upload/: This endpoint is used for uploading a video file. The server saves the uploaded file temporarily and responds with the filename.

POST /process_video/: This endpoint takes a filename (representing a previously uploaded file) and a silent_threshold parameter. It uses these parameters to call the jump_cutter function from the jump_cutter.py module for processing the video. The processed video is then returned to the client as a downloadable file. Post processing, all temporary files are deleted from the server.

jump_cutter.py: This module includes the jump_cutter function, which processes a video file based on provided parameters. The function uses various techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform, phase vocoder time stretching, and audio level analysis to remove or speed up sections of the video where the audio volume falls below a certain threshold. The goal is to trim less significant sections from the video, particularly parts with long pauses or silence.

Detailed Workflow of jump_cutter
The function begins by verifying the input video file and creating a temporary folder for further processing.
The ffmpeg tool is used to extract individual frames and audio from the input video.
The audio data is read and the volume level is analyzed for each frame of the video.
Frames with volume levels below the silent_threshold are marked as "silent". Frames within a certain margin of a "silent" frame also receive the "silent" tag.
The function then processes the frames again, creating a new audio track and set of video frames. If a frame was marked as "silent", it's either skipped or its corresponding audio is sped up, based on the sounded_speed and silent_speed parameters.
After all the frames have been processed, ffmpeg recombines the new frames and audio into a processed video file.
The function concludes by deleting the temporary folder and its contents, and returns the processed video data as a byte string.
